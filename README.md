Hi there, my name is Marcus, welcome to my page. 

I'm develop software for a range of solutions, my career so far has taken me to metadata organisation and extraction, and low code insurance platforms. I'm currently learning the Unity real-time engine to broaden my skills and hopefully break into the games industry. If you would like to get in contact, please reach out on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-mcnaught-33057220b/
